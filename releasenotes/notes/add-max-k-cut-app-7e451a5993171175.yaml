    Adding the Max-k-cut application :class:`qiskit_optimization.applications.Maxkcut`.

    Problem: Given an undirected graph, find a partition of nodes into at most k subsets such
    that the total weight of the edges between the k subsets is maximized.

    To solve this problem, the space-efficient quantum optimization algorithm for the graph
    coloring problem proposed in [1] is used.
